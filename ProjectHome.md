The S2 Geometry Library is a spherical geometry library, very useful for manipulating regions on the sphere (commonly on Earth) and indexing geographic data. For an analogous library in C++, please see http://code.google.com/p/s2-geometry-library/.

Note: This library will change going forward, transitioning mutable classes to immutable ones, where appropriate. This will likely result in public constructors being replaced with static factory methods (see Effective Java, Item 1).
